# Book-Alchemy
Book-Alchemy is a web application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy that allows users to manage a library of books and authors.
Users can add new authors and books, search for books by title, and view details of each book, including the author's name and a cover image fetched from the Open Library API.
The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for organizing and exploring your personal library collection.
